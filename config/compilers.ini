# This config file specifies how to identify the compiler in use,
# how to invoke it, how to put it into a strictly standards-compliant
# mode, and how to interpret certain things in its output.
# There is one section for each compiler, plus some defaults.
#
# Options and their meanings:
#
#  id_macro:     Macro which this compiler defines to identify itself.
#  id_regexp:    Regular expression which should match the 'version' output
#                of this compiler (see below).  This should have a named
#                match group (?P<version> ... ) which extracts the
#                version number.  If the version number might appear in
#                two different places, use <version1> and <version2> instead.
#                Optionally, include a <details> match group to extract
#                additional detail about the compiler.  If that might appear
#                in two different places, use <details1> and <details2> instead.
#  imitated:     Set to 'yes' if other compilers imitate this compiler to
#                the extent of defining the id_macro.
#
#  define:       Command line switch that defines a macro.  It is assumed
#                that the macro to define should be appended to the specified
#                string, and should be in the form NAME=VALUE.
#  compile:      Space-separated list of command line options to compile a
#                source file without linking.  If possible, disable the
#                assembler too; even better, disable everything but validity
#                checking.  You should also turn on aggressive warnings and
#                make warnings into errors; however, do *not* request strict
#                conformance with any level of the C standard in this set of
#                options. Each dollar sign will be replaced by the basename
#                of the source file (i.e. with ".c" chopped off).
#  preproc:      As 'compile', but for running the preprocessor only.
#                This MUST output to a file, not to stdout.
#  version:      Command line options to get the compiler to print its
#                version number.  In some cases it is necessary to provide
#                a source file to make this happen (MSVC, HP acc); an argument
#                "$.c" or "$.i" will do that.
#  preproc_out:  Name of the file that a 'preproc' invocation will produce.
#  compile_out:  Name of the file that a 'compile' invocation will produce,
#                if any.
#  version_out:  Name of the file that a 'version' invocation will produce,
#                if any.
#
#  conform:      Command line options to put this compiler in a mode in which
#                it is strictly conformant with its default level of the C
#                standard.  Do *not* request conformance with any specific
#                level of the standard in this set of options; only disable
#                extended features. (If the only options that have this effect
#                also select a specific standard level, leave this blank.)
#
#  c1989:        Options to make this compiler conform specifically with
#                the 1989 C standard.  Can be blank.
#  c1999:        Options to make this compiler conform specifically with
#                the 1999 C standard.  Can be blank.  If unsupported, write
#                "c1999 = no".
#  c2011:        Options to make this compiler conform specifically with
#                the 2011 C standard.  Can be blank.  If unsupported, write
#                "c2011 = no".  (If the compiler supports C1989 only, you must
#                explicitly declare both C1999 and C2011 as unsupported.)
#  threads:      Options required for compiling threaded code, if any.
#
# notfound_re:   Regular expression which matches this compiler's error message
#                for when an #include file does not exist.
# errloc_re:     Regular expression which extracts the file name and line number
#                from this compiler's error messages, as named groups
#                <file> and <line> respectively.
